–run vagrant file
–when installation ends, reload vagrant by vagrant halt and vagrant up
–open terminal, paste this command:
alias python=python3

–It’s important to launch pycharm as sudo, because otherwise there will be troubles with permissions, so:
cd /opt/pycharm-community-2017.1/bin
sudo ./pycharm.sh

–Pycharm offers you to open the project: srv/gamingplatform

–We need to set the Python Interpreter to 3.4
Now exit PyCharm and paste this commad to the terminal:
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

When it’s launched, the only thing left is to install few packages:
pyTelegramBotAPI
pymongo
requests
jsonpickle
botlab
and update 2 of them:
update urllib3 to the latest
update requests to the latest

That’s it, everything should work fine, I tested this workflow several times
